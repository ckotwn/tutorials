# Subscribing to Alerts of Taiwanese Journals

Taiwanese journal publications are mostly hosted by Airiti Inc. One can subscribe to alerts of preferred journals through the Airiti Library system.

### Steps

#### 1. Create an account

The sign-up procedure is similar to other web sites. One should receive a confirmation email for validating the communication between the user and the system.


#### 2. Add a subscription

When on the main page of a journal, above the search box, click "My Subscriptions" should add the journal to one's subscriptions.

Please note that the system automatically log you out if idle long enough, so click "My Subscriptions" could lead to a log-in request.


#### 3. Managing subscriptions

There subscriptions are listed. "Cancel" stops the alerts, "Remove", well, also stops the alerts (and lifts cognative pressure, too).
